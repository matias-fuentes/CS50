### 2021: version: https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/

## FAQs

### Where are the first two labs?

Well, since I've made this study program through 2020 and 2021, and since the study program content updates every year,
the labs didn't exist in the 2020 version, so I didn't have to do them.

### And the other stuff to do that appears in the psets of the official webpage?

These are part of newer versions. However, you might see them on the 2020 and 2021 version webpage because they update
even their outdated webpage versions of the study program, so that nobody submits outdated projects, even if they're
seeing an outdated version webpage of the study program.

### So, what includes the 2020 and 2021 version?

The 2020 version includes only the problem sets, while the 2021 includes the problem sets and the labs.
