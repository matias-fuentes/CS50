# CS50

## HarvardX's Professional Certificate at Computer Science (CS50)

CS50 it's a Harvard University study program. An online and a free one. With notes, slides, source code, videos, labs, zoom videoclasses, and much more, CS50 it's the perfect place to grow, and learn.

And here I not only learned how to develop a webpage, but also, I learned a lot about programming in general and its fundamental basis. Since low-level code with C lang with memory, data structures, addresses, pointers, etc, to high-level code, with Python with Flask, and even React!

And not only did I learn frontend code, but also, backend code! With SQL and Flask with forms, POST methods, sessions, authentication, and a lot more!

### About this career

-   A broad and robust understanding of computer science and programming
-   How to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently
-   Concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software
    engineering, and web development
-   Familiarity in a number of languages, including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML
-   How to engage with a vibrant community of like-minded learners from all levels of experience
-   How to develop and present a final programming project to your peers
-   Database design, scalability, security, and user experience Through hands-on projects, you'll learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku.

"By course's end, you'll emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower you to
design and deploy applications on the Internet."

CS50 in a nutshell, was a 180 degree turn in my life.
